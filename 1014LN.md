## Topic
- Further execution order in testbench


##  Demo code
Below is a design implementation for full adder.
```sh
`timescale 1ns/10ps
module challenge
  (
   input  wire  [2:0]    SW,
   output logic [1:0]    LED
   );

  // SW[2] is carry in
  // SW[1] is A
  // SW[0] is B
  assign LED[0]  = SW[0] ^ SW[1] ^ SW[2]; // Write the code for the Sum
  assign LED[1]  = (SW[0] && SW[1]) || (SW[2] && (SW[0] ^ SW[1])) ; // Write the code for the Carry
endmodule // challenge
```

Below is a testbench implementation for full adder.
```sh
`timescale 1ns/10ps;
module tb;
  logic [2:0] SW;
  logic [1:0] LED;
  challenge u_challenge (.*);

  // Stimulus
  initial begin
    $printtimescale(tb);
    //SW = 3`b000;
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
      $display("Setting switches to %3b", i[2:0]);
      SW  = i[2:0];
      #100;
    end
    $display("PASS: logic_ex test PASSED!");
    $stop;
  end

  logic [1:0] sum;
  assign sum = SW[0] + SW[1] + SW[2];
  // Checking
  always @(SW, LED) begin
    #1;
    if (sum !== LED) begin
      $display("FAIL: Addition mismatch");
      $stop;
    end
  end 
endmodule // tb
```

Initially the test did not pass since LED was X state, and !== considered X not identical with 0 or 1 or Z.

This is due to the conflict of assign and always, which are both instantly executed after the input changes. LED is calculated from SW in design code (assign), when code in always block executed earlier than design code, X state happened.

__To avoid that, a small delay #1 is added in the checking part, and now always block is after the design code.__




## When to use wire or logic
When You Must Use wire:

Tristate (Bidirectional) Buses:
If you're modeling tristate buses (i.e., bidirectional signals or open-drain behavior), you need to use wire. A logic signal cannot have multiple drivers, but a wire can handle this because it allows for high-impedance (Z) states.
Example:
```sh
wire bus;
assign bus = (enable) ? data : 1'bz; // Tristate bus
Multiple Drivers:
```

If a signal has multiple drivers, you must use wire. For example, if multiple modules or assign statements are driving the same signal, wire must be used because it allows for continuous assignments from different drivers.
Example:
```sh
wire result;
assign result = cond1 ? signal1 : 1'bz; // Multiple drivers
assign result = cond2 ? signal2 : 1'bz;
```

__Best Practices:__

Use logic when:
You are working with procedural blocks like always, initial, or always_ff, where you may assign values within the block.
You want to avoid the confusion between reg and wire in traditional Verilog, as logic can replace both.
You are writing code that doesn’t involve tristate buses or multiple drivers.

Use wire when:
You are connecting module inputs/outputs that might have multiple drivers or tristate buses.
You are writing purely combinational logic using continuous assignments (i.e., assign statements) and don’t plan to use the signal in procedural code.
