Binary Coding and One-hot Coding


[XSIM 43-3281] Parameter/Generic UNIQUE_CASE  specified in commandline not found in design.
Debug: do not set subsource as the top.


I cannot test a single module. why 

No idea what happended, but I did the same yet this works out. Set the both selectors correctly, set only the submodule under the design module as the top, simulation is good, bitstream is generated as expected. Maybe it's because I change only the test case, not the unique case as last time.
