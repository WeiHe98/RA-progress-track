How to flash the default firmware to P101

1. Take out the microSD card, put into Windows PC, use SD card Formatter to format into FAT32.
2. Copy the five files into the microSD card, do not delete anything in the microSD card itself. The five files are BOOT.bin, devicetree.dtb, uEnv.txt, uImage, and uramdisk.image.gz.
   Some files are not necessary. But it's good to copy paste them all.
3. Insert the microSD card back into P101, regulat boot.
